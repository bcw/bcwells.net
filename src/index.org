#+TITLE: Brian C. Wells' Homepage -- bcwells.net
#+OPTIONS: toc:1

Hi.  I am Brian C. Wells, and this is my personal website.  I intend
to publish software and articles about whatever interests me: mostly
computer science, mathematics, and economics/politics.

Since January of 2016, I have been an Associate Member of the [[https://www.fsf.org/][Free
Software Foundation]], which simply means I donate $10/month to help
them develop all their great software (and advocate for software
freedom!).  Until recently, I used a 100% free software Operating
System (OS): [[https://trisquel.info/][Trisquel GNU/Linux]]. However Trisquel has not been updated
for a long time (according to the website, which I have no reason to
doubt, the last major version was released in November
2014). Therefore I have switched back to [[https://www.debian.org/][Debian GNU/Linux]], which I
used before learning about Trisquel.

I still think the [[https://libreboot.org/faq/][Libreboot FAQ]] is well worth a read, and do own an
older computer which runs Libreboot, but I have to concede that I
don't use it often, and I more regularly use a modern computer from
[[https://www.thinkpenguin.com/][ThinkPenguin]]. Hopefully we can eventually have a computer that both
respects our freedom and is modern/stylish, but I am not going to
suggest that people abandon modern PCs any more. My cell phone still
runs [[http://www.replicant.us/][Replicant]], another fully free OS based on Android.

** June 13, 2017: Migrating to a VPS

I got tired of not being able to run a server as I see fit, so I am
migrating my website from shared hosting to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server][virtual private server]]
(VPS) provider [[https://www.linode.com/][Linode]]. I have taken the opportunity to update some of
this page to reflect changes made recently, but otherwise I am not
changing anything on the site yet. It will still be a static site for
a while, though I may eventually replace it with something else.

* Software
** org-tex-define

A simple literate program that uses an (apparently) undocumented
feature of Org mode to make /all/ varieties of (La)TeX definitions
work in both HTML and PDF output.

- [[file:software/org-tex-define/define.html][HTML format]]
- [[file:software/org-tex-define/define.pdf][PDF format]]
- [[https://github.com/bcw/org-tex-define][Git source repository]]

* Articles
** rotation

A purely algebraic derivation of the 2-D [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix][rotation matrix]].  First
article that uses [[org-tex-define]].

- [[file:articles/rotation.pdf][PDF format]]

You can send email to my first name (Brian) at this domain.
* Colophon

This site was made using the [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]], together with an
Emacs Lisp file which sets up the corresponding Org mode projects and
a Makefile which is used by GNU Make to run the publishing functions.
Rather than publishing directly to the server, however, I prefer to
first "publish" locally so I can review the output.  The Makefile and
zip utility also generate a compressed file with all the output.  Once
I am satisfied, I upload [[file:site.zip]] manually and decompress it.  (I
also leave it there, so if you want a copy of the final product only,
that is one option for you.) Another advantage of this somewhat
convoluted process is that I do not need an SSH account on the web
server (for my webhost, getting that requires to jump through some
hoops I can't be bothered to do yet).

If you want the Org mode source for a single webpage, I also include
that in my publishing configuration.  So just replace the ~.html~ with
~.org~ in any of the URLs (~index.org~ for URLs that end in a slash).
If you would like a copy of the /whole/ source code, including the
Emacs Lisp configuration and Makefile I mentioned above, then you can
find it in [[https://github.com/bcw/bcwells.net][this GitHub repository]].  I hereby license it under GNU
AGPLv3+, so you can copy and modify it in any way and for any reason,
as long as you (1) give credit (acknowledgement for work) where due
and (2) let others do all the same things you can do.
