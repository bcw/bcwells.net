#+TITLE: Brian C. Wells' Homepage -- bcwells.net
#+OPTIONS: toc:1

Hi.  I am Brian C. Wells, and this is my personal website.  I intend
to publish software and articles about whatever interests me: mostly
computer science, mathematics, and economics/politics.

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt FSF member since 2016-01-19

Since January of 2016, I have been an Associate Member of the [[https://www.fsf.org/][Free
Software Foundation]], which simply means I donate $10/month to help
them develop all their great software (and advocate for software
freedom!).  I use a 100% free software Operating System (OS).  My
laptop computer runs [[https://trisquel.info/][Trisquel GNU/Linux]] --- based on Ubuntu (and
therefore also Debian), but with /all non-free software removed/.
Until very recently, I bought most hardware, including laptops, from
[[https://www.thinkpenguin.com/][ThinkPenguin]]; but after reading the [[https://libreboot.org/faq/][Libreboot FAQ]] (if you read nothing
else, read that!), I have decided to buy only computers which run free
boot firmware (in addition to a fully free OS).  On my cell phone, I
run [[http://www.replicant.us/][Replicant]], another fully free OS --- based on Android, but again
with all non-free software removed.  I also canceled my Netflix
subscription because I am tired of financially supporting a "service"
that I can only actually use on some device that I supposedly "own"
and yet they have stolen my right to control.  I'm some years late to
the party, admittedly; but I'd still recommend [[https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/cancel-netflix-if-you-value-freedom][you cancel Netflix too]]!

** September 15, 2016: In Which I Learn Why Libreboot is Important

As mentioned above, the [[https://libreboot.org/faq/][Libreboot FAQ]] is definitely worth reading.
It's scary, but you're always better off knowing where you are than
sticking your head in the sand.  For those who want a summary:
apparently /both/ Intel and AMD have completely hamstrung our ability
to run even modestly secure computers.  By which I mean, they have
*intentionally designed all modern computers* so that they are capable
of being *totally controlled by third parties* via the Internet, and
there is *technically nothing that can be done about it*.  The only
solution at present is to completely *avoid all Intel hardware made
after 2008*, and *all AMD hardware made after 2013*.

Unfortunately, that means we are currently faced with a stark choice:

1. abandon all hope of using an even modestly secure computer, in
   favor of a computer that looks "nice" and "modern"; or

2. use Libreboot with somewhat old hardware, in favor of having the
   potential to be secure (although certainly not the guarantee!).

Until I read the Libreboot FAQ, for some reason I had thought that it
was possible to find some "middle ground", to be more secure than most
and still have a nice-looking, modern PC.  But it is now clear to me
that that is /not/ possible.  Any computer that uses modern hardware
is /completely incapable/ of resisting (at least) this type of attack.
All it takes is /one/ group of people who have the knowledge and
desire to pull it off.  And such groups exist both inside and outside
your own government.  Then, once they figure out how to crack into
your computer, it's just a matter of time before it spreads to other
similarly-minded groups, and widely exploited.  (By "corruption", in
this case bribery of individuals, if not by any other way.)

** August 26, 2016: Something Useful!

I finally have something to put on this website which I think is
genuinely useful to someone besides me.  I used Emacs Org mode to
write an article on how to derive [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix][rotation matrices]] by purely
algebraic methods, and I wanted to publish it in both [[file:articles/rotation.html][HTML]] and [[file:articles/rotation.pdf][PDF]]
formats.  But since it uses a lot of mathematical notation, I ran into
a problem that both I and others have had with Org mode: the MathJax
library (for LaTeX math in HTML) and /real/ LaTeX (for PDF) have
/slightly/ different expectations for where and how LaTeX macros
should be defined, and [[http://stackoverflow.com/q/12717654][Org mode does not try to solve the problem]].

Several people have provided work-arounds for the problem, but so far
they all seem to require either

1. installing a large Emacs Lisp (~.el~) file somewhere, and still
   quite clunky to use, such as manually updating a dynamic block; or
2. using only a single very restricted method of defining macros,
   namely ~\global\def~ inside ~\(...\)~ in an Org mode drawer.

Inspired by [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-macros][another GitHub repository]] to take advantage of Org mode's
(undocumented?) ability to evaluate Emacs Lisp code in its own native
macro definitions (at least in the version I tested with), I managed
to write an Org mode setup file which has neither of these problems.
The source code is available as an Org mode literate program in [[https://github.com/bcw/org-tex-define][this
GitHub repository]], the [[file:define.setup][unannotated setup file is here]], and [[rotation]] is
the article I wrote it for.

* Software
** org-tex-define

A simple literate program that uses an (apparently) undocumented
feature of Org mode to make /all/ varieties of (La)TeX definitions
work in both HTML and PDF output.

- [[file:software/org-tex-define/define.pdf][PDF format]]
- [[https://github.com/bcw/org-tex-define][Git source repository]]

* Articles
** rotation

A purely algebraic derivation of the 2-D [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix][rotation matrix]].  First
article that uses [[org-tex-define]].

This site was made using the [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]], together with an
Emacs Lisp file which sets up the corresponding Org mode projects and
a Makefile which is used by GNU Make to run the publishing functions.
Rather than publishing directly to the server, however, I prefer to
first "publish" locally so I can review the output.  The Makefile and
zip utility also generate a compressed file with all the output.  Once
I am satisfied, I upload [[file:site.zip]] manually and decompress it.  (I
also leave it there, so if you want a copy of the final product only,
that is one option for you.) Another advantage of this somewhat
convoluted process is that I do not need an SSH account on the web
server (for my webhost, getting that requires to jump through some
hoops I can't be bothered to do yet).

If you want the Org mode source for a single webpage, I also include
that in my publishing configuration.  So just replace the ~.html~ with
~.org~ in any of the URLs (~index.org~ for URLs that end in a slash).
If you would like a copy of the /whole/ source code, including the
Emacs Lisp configuration and Makefile I mentioned above, then you can
find it in [[https://github.com/bcw/bcwells.net][this GitHub repository]].  I hereby license it under GNU
AGPLv3+, so you can copy and modify it in any way and for any reason,
as long as you (1) give credit (acknowledgement for work) where due
and (2) let others do all the same things you can do.
